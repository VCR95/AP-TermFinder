# ArithmeticProgression-TermFinder
Calculates any nth term of an Arithmetic Progression of higher order.

Usage is straight forward. User is prompted to insert any sequence of arithmetic progression with at least 3 terms and then asked what term they wish to find.

Program should find any nth term no matter the order.

For example:

Enter how many terms are in the sequence: 5

Enter number 1: 1

Enter number 2: 27

Enter number 3: 125

Enter number 4: 343

Enter number 5: 729


Enter the term you wish to find: 7

(which means, find the 7th term of the sequence).


Output: An = 2197

--

This progression exemplified is of 3rd order. That is, there are 2 APs inside of it and the program loops back through them (via recursion) to find the result.

Program will also work with descending sequences as well as negative numbers.
